## Introduction to Python
- **helloWorld.py** - A basic "Hello, World!" program to get started with Python.

## Control Flow
- **if_else.py** - Introduction to conditional statements in Python (`if`, `else`, and `elif`).
- **for_loop.py** - Examples demonstrating the use of `for` loops.
- **while_loop.py** - Usage of `while` loops, including loop control with conditions.
- **continue.py** - Demonstrates the use of the `continue` statement to skip iterations within loops.

## Data Structures
- **lists.py** - Covers list operations, such as adding, removing, and accessing elements, and includes list comprehensions.
- **Dictionary.py** - Basic operations on dictionaries, including creating, updating, and accessing dictionary elements.
- **strings.py** - Examples of string manipulation, including slicing, concatenation, and various string methods.

## Functions and Modules
- **functions.py** - Explains how to define and use functions, including parameters, return values, and function calls.
- **Modules.ipynb** - A Jupyter Notebook that covers the usage of modules in Python, including importing built-in and custom modules.

## File Handling
- **File_write_read.py** - Demonstrates file handling in Python, including reading from and writing to text files.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Class.py** - Basic implementation of classes and object-oriented programming concepts, including creating classes and objects.

## Exception Handling
- **execptions.py** - Examples of handling exceptions using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors gracefully.

## Working with JSON
- **json_read.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook explaining how to work with JSON files in Python, including reading and parsing JSON data.
- **json_test.py** - Demonstrates reading and writing JSON data to files using Python's `json` module.
